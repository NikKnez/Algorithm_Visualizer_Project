## 📊 Algorithm Visualizer 

#### 🌟 Overview
Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize the functioning of various algorithms. Built with a modern tech stack including Java Spring Boot and React, this project serves as a comprehensive educational tool and a showcase of efficient software architecture.

#### 📄 Features
- Visualize different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
- Real-time updates of algorithm execution
- Explanation of selected algorithms
- Responsive design for various device sizes

#### 💻 Technologies
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Spring Boot, Maven
- Development Tools: IntelliJ IDEA for backend, Visual Studio Code for frontend

## 🚀 Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.15.0 or later)
- Java (JDK 17 or later)
- Maven

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository: `[git clone <repository-url>](https://github.com/NikKnez/algorithm-visualizer-front.git)` and then
`cd algorithm-visualizer-front`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd AlgorithmVvisualizer`
2. Build and run the Spring Boot application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- Build Errors: If you encounter issues with the build process, make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date. Check for compatibility issues between dependencies and ensure that the `target` folder is correctly handled.
- Module Not Found: Ensure that all required modules are installed. For React projects, ensure `react` and other dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json`.
- Unsupported Errors: If encountering errors related to crypto routines, try setting the environment variable for Node.js: `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
